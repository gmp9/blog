Blog

== README

This code is for a blog with authentication using Devise and authorization using Pundit.
Please consult the Gemfile for a list of the gems used in this app.
There are 5 database tables.
Basically, the app first checks a user's authentication and then whether that user is authorized.
As of now, this app only authorizes an admin.
If the user is authorized, then the person can create a new blog, post it, delete it, etc.
